        </div>
        <p class="First-Paragraph">"Re-driven" suggests that someone is getting the chance to drive a beloved car again—a car they thought was lost forever. 
            It ties directly to the act of driving a car that once meant something deeply personal. "Driven again" also symbolizes a person rekindling their passion, sense of identity, or cherished memories through that car.
            It evokes the feeling of being "driven by purpose again"—a second chance, a restored connection, a revived dream.

        <p class="Second-Paragraph">ReDriven is a charitable initiative that helps people reunite with the classic cars that once meant everything to them—cars they lost to time, hardship, or circumstance.
            Helps individuals track down and reconnect with their long-lost vehicles or identical models. Uses VIN tracing, community outreach, car clubs, and social media campaigns.
            Example: A veteran wants to find the ‘67 Mustang he sold decades ago to pay for medical bills—ReDriven helps track it down.
            ReDriven shares heartwarming stories of reunions and restorations, raising awareness about the emotional power of cars and preserving personal and automotive history.
            These stories drive donations, inspire volunteers, and bring communities together.
